Answer


select id_lisiting
    case when 
from full_file f
join bookings b on b.listing_id = f.listing_id
where ds = current_date








insert into listing_books from (
select id_listing, *
 from 
 (
select
      id_listing
    , sum(m_bookings) over (partition by id_listing order by ds rows between 90 days preceding and current row) as nbookings_past_90_days
    , sum(m_bookings) over ( partition by id_listing  rows between 365 days preceding and current row) as nbookings_past_90_days
    , sum(m_bookings) over (order by id_listing) as n_bookings_total

 from bookings
 where current_date -ds <= n
 ) ) group by id_listing




full file:

select  id_listing
      , sum (case when ds > current_date  - 90 then m_bookings else 0 end ) as nbookings_past_90 days
      , sum (case when ds > current_date  - 365 then m_bookings else 0 end ) as nbookings_past_365 days
      , sum (m_bookings) as n_bookings_total

from bookings
group by id_listing


past_90 days






select  id_listing
      , mbookings  as past_90_booking
     
from bookings
where ds = DAYS(current_date - 90)
group by id_listing

past_365_days:

select  id_listing
      , mbookings  as past_365_booking
     
from bookings
where ds = DAYS(current_date - 90)
group by id_listing


changes: ongoing

select  id_listing
      , nbookings_past_90 + m_bookings - past_90day_booking
      , nbookings_past_365 + mbookings - past_365day_booking
      , n_bookings_total  + mbookings 

from bookings
join past_90 p on p.id_lisiting = b.id_listing
join past_365 on p.
, join full_file on id_listing = id
where booking_2
group by id_listing




select  id_listing
      , m_bookings

from bookings
where ds >= current_date - n days
and ds <= current_date -n days
