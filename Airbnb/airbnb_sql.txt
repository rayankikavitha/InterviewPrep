Imagine the data is batch and partitioned on datetimestamp

1) find 90 days, 365 days ,total booking amount for a listing
2) How do you find the same thing 90days, 365day, total today? 
   Note: Use yesterday's dump to derive today's
   So, you need to find changes only.
   Thoughts/Answers. 
   Since we have 90 days dump already, add current date listing_id details to the dump
   and remove the 91sth old amount.
3) How to enhance this to automate it to run it for last 7 days, last 1 month , last quarter
4) Now imagine some one says that database is stale after a week how do you redo this entire work?
  - Thoughts:
5) How to python ETL "for finding something " from this data



================================
insert into dump from (
select listing_id
     , sum ( case when date(ds) >= (current-date -90) then booking_amount else 0 end) as booking_amount_90days_lookback
     , sum ( case when date(ds) >= (current-date -365) then booking_amount else 0 end) as booking_amount_365days_lookback
     , sum ( booking_amount) as booking_amount_total
from booking
group by listing_id
);

finding changes:
